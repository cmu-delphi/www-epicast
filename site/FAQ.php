	1. What data I should be basing a forecast on, is
        it the situation of people in my current state?
      </font>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Answer: You should forecast whatever you think will actually
      happen in the location you are forecasting.

	2. Why did you choose to forecast "% of doctor
        visits that involve flu-like symptoms"?  Is this the only measure
        you are interested in?
      </font>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Answer: This is the measure CDC asked us to forecast first.  An
      elaborate system for measuring it already exists, and is being
      re-purposed to measure covid-19 levels.  We will likely also be
      asked to forecast measures related to covid-19 hospitalization.

	3. "This seems like the wrong measure - I think
        many COVID-19 patients may be diagnosed over the phone, and many
        routine visits may be cancelled during this period.”
      </font>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Answer: In that case, you should factor these beliefs into your
      forecasts.

	4. “I think the best thing to nowcast would be
        the number of true cases; and the best thing to forecast would be
        the number of COVID-19 deaths, or perhaps excess mortality, to
        capture deaths from all causes that occur because the healthcare
        system is overwhelmed."
      </font>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Answer: There are indeed other valuable measures to forecast.  In
      another project (not crowdsourced) we are forecasting future
      demand on hospitals.
