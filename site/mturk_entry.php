<!-- spoof the value of the current epiweek. Normally that comes from the table
ec_fluv_round, but to pretend like it's some other week in the past you can
override the value from the database. But you'll also have to fetch unstable
wILI from a different season, and the number of weeks in the season depends on
what the year is (i.e. the 2014-2015 season has an extra week: 2014w53). I would 
start with overriding the round counter from the database and then
debugging/fixing until everything works. -->
